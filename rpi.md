**Project Description:**
I built this project for a computer organization course, for which the final project required use of a Raspberry Pi.  I created a car music player because I felt it would be both fun and functional.  My friend drives a 2002 Prius, which does not feature the sleek touch screen display of newer cars.  I treated him as a client during the development process, and he had input on how he wanted the car player to look.  The product was built using Python and Kivy, a library for developing user interfaces.  This project required a combination of software and hardware, which was a unique and fun challenge.
