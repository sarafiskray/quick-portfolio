# DJAZE iOS

<img src="images/spotifyfire.png?raw=true" width="100%" />

DJAZE is an iOS application designed to give everyone a voice when it comes to music selection at bars or parties.  It includes a live song request system, using the Spotify Web API and Firebase Firestore, as well as a democratic upvote and downvote feature.  It is a two-sided system, with pages for both DJs/hosts and regular users.  DJAZE is still under development as there are a few features we are still looking to add.
