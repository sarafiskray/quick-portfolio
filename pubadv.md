**Project Description:**
The Landlord Watchlist is a project created by the Office of the Public Advocate that exposes the worst landlords in NYC.  During my time at the office, I contributed to various aspects of the Landlord Watchlist.  I did data cleaning and data modeling using Python as well as developed a RESTful API using Flask.  I also wrote SQL queries to optimize the search engine and began the creation of a new search engine.
