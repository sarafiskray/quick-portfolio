**Project Description:**
This project was an early university project built for a C++ course.  Our goal was to create an application that allows the user to move around and create art.  What started as a simple idea was not so simple to implement.  

## Download:

To get started, download the code from the <a href="https://github.com/sarafiskray/Art-Game" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a> or directly <a href="/zip/C++_Abstract_Art.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.  Open main.cpp in your favorite C++ IDE (I use CLion), press Run, and enjoy.
