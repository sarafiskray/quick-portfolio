**Project Description:**
This project was an early university project built for a C++ course.  Our goal was to create an application that allows the user to move around and create art.  What started as a simple idea was not so simple to implement.  

## Download:

To get started, download the code from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sarafiskray/Art-Game) or directly [here](/szip/C++_Abstract_Art.zip).  Open main.cpp in your favorite C++ IDE (I use CLion), press Run, and enjoy.
