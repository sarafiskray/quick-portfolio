<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

I am a recent graduate from the University of Vermont, where I studied Computer Science and Spanish.  I like to work all across the stack, but I lean more towards back-end development.  I enjoy working and learning with others and hopefully building software that has a positive impact. I currently work part-time with Juni Learning, teaching one-on-one Zoom classes to elementary and middle school children in Python and JavaScript.

Some of my other interests include, hiking, biking, cooking, and watching sports.  Go Nets!  I am trilingual in English, Spanish, and Bengali.

I am open to full time work!
