**Project Description:**
The Millennial Recipe System is a full-stack web application built with MongoDB, Python, Flask, and React.  It is a classic recipe system, allowing users to create accounts and post recipes.  My focus for this project was the back-end.  Unfortunately, as this project was built for a university course, the live website is no longer accessible.
