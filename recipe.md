**Project Description:**
The Millennial Recipe System is a full-stack web application built with MongoDB, Python, Flask, and React.  It is a classic recipe system, allowing users to create accounts and post recipes.  My focus for this project was the back-end.  Unfortunately, as this project was built for a university course, the live website is no longer accessible.

## System Overview:

My focus on this project was the back-end, as I had more back-end experience than other project members.  I wanted to use a NoSQL database for this system, as different recipes can have a different number of ingredients.  In addition, I had some experience with Flask from working on the Landlord Watchlist.  The API was hosted on Amazon Web Services while the front-end React App was hosted on University of Vermont Silk.
